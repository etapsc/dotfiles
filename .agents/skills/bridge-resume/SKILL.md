description: Resume development in a fresh session - load context and output brief. Invoke with $bridge-resume in your prompt.

Fresh session. Load docs/requirements.json and docs/context.json.

Follow `.agents/procedures/bridge-session-management.md` (Fresh Session Re-entry) to output the brief.

## Specialist Decision Before Further Work

Before the final HUMAN block in the re-entry brief:

1. Check `execution.specialists_recommended` in requirements.json. If it is empty or absent, skip this section silently.
2. Determine the active slice features:
   - Prefer `context.json.next_slice.features` when present
   - Else if `context.json.next_slice.slice_id` exists, resolve that slice ID in `requirements.json.execution.recommended_slices`
   - Else if `context.json.current_slice` is a slice ID, resolve that ID in `requirements.json.execution.recommended_slices`
3. Match specialist `applicable_features` against that feature list.
4. For each matching specialist, verify the file exists at `.agents/specialists/<id>.md`.
5. Insert a `SPECIALISTS SUGGESTED` block before the final HUMAN block. Do NOT load those specialists yet.
6. The final HUMAN block should OFFER the option to reply `load specialists`, `no specialists`, or name a subset — a non-blocking suggestion, not a precondition for further work.
7. If the user replies `load specialists` or names a subset, read those files immediately, output a `SPECIALISTS LOADED` block, and use them for all following work in this thread until the user opts out or the slice/context changes.
8. If the next user message gives task work or a command without answering the specialist question, proceed with that work immediately — do NOT re-ask or block. Default to not loading specialists for that turn; you may note once that the user can reply `load specialists` to apply the suggested guidance.
9. If the user replies `no specialists`, continue without them.

## HUMAN: Block (required)

Your response MUST end with a HUMAN: block. The session-management procedure includes one — include it verbatim. If specialists were suggested, the HUMAN: block should offer specialist loading as an option (non-blocking — explicit task work or a command proceeds without it). Never omit the HUMAN: block.

Then wait for instructions.
